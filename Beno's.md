# Beno's Deli

### History of Beno's Deli
The First Beno's Deli was in Lake City MN, started by Ron and Joan Shimbeno. They had a location in Red Wing as well, but then both locations were closed. A friend then bought the deli. The deli burned down, and is now in the old city hall building in Winona.
